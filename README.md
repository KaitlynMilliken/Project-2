# My Doctor
An app developed with Javascript, jquery, css, bootstrap, mysql2, handlebars, node and express.js. We also utilized the tensorFlow.js technology to import some capablities to our app.
# Description
My Doctor is an easy to use social media like application for doctors to answer patient questions on a variety of topics concerning health of patients. This application also answers concerning questions on COVID-19. When looking up symptoms and finding exact answers on how you are feeling is not always easy. Calling your doctor or going in person to the doctor is not always convenient so having an interactive platform to easily be able to talk with experts about your concerning health conditions builds.
# User Story
AS a person concerned about my health                                                                                                    
I WANT to be able to have a direct line to a professional                                    
SO THAT incase the doctor office is backed up or inconvenient.
